# 16 KB Page Size Compliance Analysis for Flutter App

## CONTEXT
I am preparing my Flutter application for the new Google Play policy (16 KB page size), which becomes mandatory on 11/01/2025. I used a script to generate a memory alignment report of all native libraries (.so) in my project.

## TASK
Analyze the two provided files below (the alignment report and project dependencies) and provide a complete diagnosis and an action plan.

---

## FILE 1: Alignment Report (`relatorio_alinhamento.txt`)

<paste here the complete content of your relatorio_alinhamento.txt>

---

## FILE 2: Project Dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`)

<paste here the list of your project dependencies>

---

## EXPECTED RESPONSE FORMAT
Please structure your response exactly as follows:

1.  **Compliant Libraries:** List all `.so` files with alignment `0x4000` (16 KB) or higher.
2.  **Non-compliant Libraries:** List all `.so` files with alignment `0x1000` (4 KB). If there are none, state this.
3.  **Library Origins:** For each listed `.so`, identify its most likely source (Flutter Engine, NDK, or a specific `pubspec.yaml` package).
4.  **Action Plan:** If there are non-compliant libraries, suggest clear corrective actions for each one (e.g., "Update the `sentry_flutter` package to version `X.Y.Z` or higher").
5.  **Final Conclusion:** Clearly state whether the application is READY or NOT READY for the new Google Play policy.
